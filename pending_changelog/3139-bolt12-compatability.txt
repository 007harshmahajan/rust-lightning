## Backwards Compatibility
 * BOLT12 `Offers` created in prior versions are still valid but are at risk of
   de-anonymization attacks.
 * BOLT12 outbound payments in state `RecentPaymentDetails::AwaitingInvoice` are
   considered invalid by `ChannelManager`. Any invoices received through the
   corresponding `InvoiceRequest` reply path will be ignored.
 * BOLT12 `Refund`s created in prior versions with non-empty `Refund::paths` are
   considered invalid by `ChannelManager`. Any invoices sent through those
   blinded paths will be ignored. `Refund`'s without blinded paths are
   unaffected.
