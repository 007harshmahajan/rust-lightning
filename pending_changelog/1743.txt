## API Updates
- A new `ChannelReady` event is generated whenever a channel becomes ready to
  be used, i.e., after both sides sent the `channel_ready` message.

## Backwards Compatibilty
- No `ChannelReady` events will be generated for previously existing channels, including
  those which become ready after upgrading 0.0.113.
