## API Updates
- `PaymentReceived` events now have `via_channel_id` and `via_user_channel_id`
  fields exposing the hop over which we received an inbound payment. Also,
  `ChannelDetails` now expose the currently observed number of `confirmations`
  on the funding transaction.

## Backwards Compatibilty
- Inbound payments with HTLCs pending on update to 0.0.113 will result
  in a `PaymentReceived` event with `user_channel_id` 0.
