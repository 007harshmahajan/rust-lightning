 * Legacy inbound payment creation has been removed, thus there is no way to
   create a pending inbound payment which will still be claimable on LDK
   0.0.103 or earlier. Support for claiming such payments is still retained,
   however is likely to be removed in the next release (#2351).
 * Some fields required in 0.0.103 and earlier are no longer written, thus
   deserializing objects written in 0.0.116 with 0.0.103 may now fail (#2351).
